## Introduction

 I am thrilled to present my latest project, which focuses on building a honeynet in Azure to simulate real-world cyber attacks. 
This project showcases my skills in Azure security, incident response, and environment hardening

## Objective
The main objective of this project was to [set up virtual machines that were intentionally vulnerable](https://github.com/steph-daws/Azure_VM_Prep) in the Azure infrastructure to attract and analyze cyber attacks. This helped me to better understand the tactics and techniques used by attackers, while also showcasing my ability to respond quickly and effectively to any identified issues.
